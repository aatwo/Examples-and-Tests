# LazyFoo_SDL_Examples

This repository contains almost all of the SDL2 example projects from http://lazyfoo.net which is an excellent place to go to learn all about SDL2.

While going through the examples that are available on the LazyFoo website I noticed a few had build errors, and since I went to the effort of producing the makefiles I figured I would make them available here.
